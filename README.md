# freegroups
Some scripts for working with finitely generated free groups and their automorphisms.
The master branch is the original python2.7 version, which also requires:
https://github.com/cashenchris/grouptheory.git

The python3 branch is the current version, which also requires grouptheory, but is now a subtree of that module.

The geometricity and virtual geometricity code requires the program 'heegaard', available at:
 https://t3m.math.uic.edu/
From the heegaard root directory, the following commands should install the 'heegaard' python module.

$ cd python
$ python setup.py install --user
